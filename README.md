# COVID-19-Detection
Implementing different CNN models to detect COVID-19 using X-Ray images.
I have used ResNet50, VGG16 pre-trained models for COVID-19 detection. I have also implemented a CNN model with VGG-baseline structure.
Implementation details are as follows:
  * covid_attempt.py - ResNet50
  * covid_attempt2.py - VGG16
  * covid_attempt3.py - VGG-baseline CNN model.

Note:
*	Implementation of the deep learning models has been inspired from Dr Adrian Rosebrock blogs(pyimagesearch).
*	Disclaimer: Deep Learning models represented in this repository are only educational and research purposes and the accuracy of the models represented don't indicate its significance to real-life applications. The systems used for detecting COVID-19 in the real-world are more robust and significant.
